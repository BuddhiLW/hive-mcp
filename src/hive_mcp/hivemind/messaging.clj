   - If backbone disconnected: direct fanout via IDeliveryChannel registry
   - Domain events (:ling/completed) are NOT dispatched here — callers
     that need domain side-effects dispatch them explicitly. This avoids
     a feedback loop: shout! → :ling/completed handler → :shout effect → shout!

   - If the shout carries no task/message/data signal (`empty-shout?` true),

     the `[] ()` no-op shouts observed during bulk-close cascades where
