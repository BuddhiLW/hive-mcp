(ns hive-mcp.scheduler.housekeeping
  "Periodic global housekeeping: clean up stale JVM-side resources.

   Runs on a scheduled executor (like decay.clj) every 5 minutes.
   Each cleanup task is individually guarded — one failure doesn't
   stop the sweep.

   Targets:
   - Stale callbacks (> 30 min)
   - Completed multi-async batches
   - Event journal old entries
   - Completed SAA states
   - Drone KG stores for dead drones
   - Bounded atom GC sweep (TTL + capacity eviction)"
