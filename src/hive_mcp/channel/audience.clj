  "Audience routing and progress digest for the HIVEMIND piggyback channel.

   Pure calculations — no I/O, no state, no requires beyond clojure.string.
   Two questions:

   - `addressed-to?` / `filter-messages` — does a shout belong in THIS
     reader's context?
   - `digest` — collapse a burst of per-turn :progress rows into one row.

   Delivery contract. A shout reaches the agent that SPAWNED the shouter and
   nobody else:

     :broadcast? true  -> every reader
     author = reader   -> never (a ling does not read back its own shout;
                          coordinator lanes are exempt so the wave scheduler
                          still sees the events it authors)
     :parent-id set    -> that reader alone
     :parent-id absent -> root-level, coordinator readers only

   Digest contract. Rows whose :e is digestible collapse, per agent, into ONE
   row carrying the burst count under :n and the LAST message under :m, sitting
   at the position of that agent's last such row. Every other event — started,
   completed, error, aborted, ask — passes through verbatim and in place."
