  "Default implementations for all :fb/* extension points.

   Registers defaults so forge strike works out of the box.
   Extensions can override when loaded via load-extensions!.

   Registration order:
   1. This module registers defaults at startup
   2. load-extensions! can overwrite with custom implementations
      ext/register! is idempotent — last write wins."
