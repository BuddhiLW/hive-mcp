(ns hive-mcp.tools.agent.spawn-guard-test
  "Tests for spawn handler defense-in-depth guard.

   Verifies that child lings (HIVE_MCP_ROLE=child-ling) cannot spawn
   agents, preventing recursive self-call chains.

   Test Coverage:
   1. Guard denies spawn for child lings (ling and drone types)
   2. Guard allows spawn for coordinator (normal path)
   3. Error message includes role, depth, and guidance
   4. Guard works with batch-spawn routing
   5. Guard logs violation with correct metadata"
